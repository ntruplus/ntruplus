# NTRU+ (https://sites.google.com/view/ntruplus/)

This website serves as the official repository for **NTRU+**, a key encapsulation mechanism (**KEM**) algorithm that was selected as one of the **final algorithms** in Round 2 of the [Korean Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition (KpqC)](https://www.kpqc.or.kr).

### Reference Implementation
- C-based implementation  
- Structured to reflect the NTRU+ specification as intuitively as possible  
- Focused on clarity, readability, and correctness

### Optimized Implementation
- High-performance C implementation  
- Fully consistent with the reference implementation  

### Additional Implementation
- Architecture-specific, hand-tuned assembly implementations
  - Intel AVX2  
  - ARMv8-A NEON  
- Fully consistent with the reference implementation
